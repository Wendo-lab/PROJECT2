FOOD SECURITY MONITORING TOOL FOR KARAMOJA REGION, UGANDA.

Introduction

As a Data Analyst, I have developed an interactive visualization tool using Tableau to display the 2017 crop season results for sorghum and maize yields in Karamoja, Uganda. It allows visualization at both district and sub-county levels, highlighting areas of low productivity to prioritize interventions.

Data Source

The dashboard is built using the provided datasets: shapefiles for Uganda districts and subcounties, crop type maps for sorghum and maize, and tabular data on yields and population.

Methods

This project uses descriptive analysis,which provides a useful overview of Karamoja's food monitoring.

Conclusion

Analysis reveals low overall yields, far below national potentials, due to droughts and pests.

Districts like Nakapiripirit and Kaabong show the lowest per capita production , indicating acute insecurity.

Total regional production covers only a few months of self-sufficiency, aligning with chronic deficits.

Business recommendation

Prioritize Low-Yield Areas
